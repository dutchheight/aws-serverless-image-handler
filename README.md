The following IAM Policy allow's craft to access your bucket:
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Create a volume with the following settings:
    - `Base URL` is your cloudfront url (*.cloudfront.net)
    - `Access Key ID` is your IAM ID
    - `Secret Access key` is your IAM secret key
    - `Bucket name` is the name of your S3 bucket
    - `Bucket region` the region for exaple us-east-1
    - `Make Uploads Public` false
    - `Focal point` false

### AWS serverless image handler
After setting up the S3 volume follow these instructions to install the plugin.
1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require dutchheight/aws-serverless-image-handler

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for AWS Serverless Image Handler.

4. Add `Toggle aws image processor` to your s3 volume field layout.

## Plugin Settings

` Serverless Distribution URL ` (optional)

This field is for the Serverless Image Handler CloudFront Distribution URL, which frees up your asset volume distribution URL to be a regular CloudFront distribution URL. This means that any asset in the volume that does not pass through this plugin (rich text fields, certain SEO plugins, etc) will be served normally. 

## Usage

In your twig template you can use:
``` twig
{% set settings = {
    width: 2600,
    height: 450
} %}
    
{{ craft.awsserverlessimagehandler.getImgUrl(entry.slider.one(), settings) }}

```

This will generate the propper URL for the asset.

If you load the image with `asset.url` the original source will be served.
